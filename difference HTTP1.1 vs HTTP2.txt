HTTP1.1
_______________
HTTP/1.1, the first standardized version of HTTP, was introduced in 1997. It presented significant performance optimizations and transformed the way requests and responses were exchanged between clients and servers.

Features 
  It was no longer required for each connection to be terminated immediately after every request was served with a response; instead, with the keep-alive header, it was possible to have persistent connections. It allowed multiple requests/responses per TCP connection. 
   
  The Upgrade header was used to indicate a preference from the client that made it possible to switch to a more preferred protocol if found appropriate by the server
HTTP2
_______________
At the beginning of 2010, Google introduced an experimental protocol, SPDY, which supported multiplexing (multiple requests/responses sent and received asynchronously over a single TCP connection) but as it gained traction IETF’s HTTP Working Group came up with HTTP/2 in 2015, which is based on the SPDY protocol.

Features 
  It introduces the concept of a server push where the server anticipates the resources that will be required by the client and pushes them prior to the client making requests. The client retains the authority to deny the server push; however, in most cases, this feature adds a lot of efficiency to the process.

  Introduces the concept of multiplexing that interleaves the requests and responses without head-of-line blocking and does so over a single TCP connection.

  It is a binary protocol i.e. only binary commands in the form of 0s and 1s are transmitted over the wire. The binary framing layer divides the message into frames that are segregated based on their type – Data or Header. This feature greatly increases efficiency in terms of security, compression and multiplexing.
